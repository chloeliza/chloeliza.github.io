# Welcome!

My name is Dr. Chloe Page. I received my PhD in Neuroscience in 2019 from Ohio State University. My predominant research interests are the mechanisms of mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as the basic biology of how we experience and process emotions. I am currently a postdoc at the University of Pittsburgh.

I assembled this website to highlight my professional portfolio and also to summarize my readings on topics of interest in the form of blog posts. These posts are an outlet for articulating my thoughts as I go through the process of learning and understanding, and also serve as a sort of laboratory for exploring how ideas inspire and inform each other. I hope you can find something of interest here as well.

## What's with the flower?

The zinnia was the [first flower to bloom in space](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/first-flower-grown-in-space-stations-veggie-facility), making it a delightful symbol of discovery, creation, and resilience. These themes inspire my work in the fields of neuroscience and mental health.
