I created a lecture series on neuroendocrinology for medical residents as part of the Pathways for Physician Scientist Training in Psychiatric Research (NIMH R25 MH125758-02) didactic on sex differences and neuroendocrinology by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Department of Psychiatry.

This content is made open access by generous funding from Open Education Resources (OER) at the University of Colorado. It is published on the open access education platform [MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMaterial.htm?id=773417418).
