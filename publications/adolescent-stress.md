The inhibitory GABAergic system in the prefrontal cortex develops substantially during adolescence, establishing a healthy balance between excitation and inhibition and contributing to the maturation of cognitive and emotional functioning. My research found that when adolescent stress is combined with genetic deficiency of Npas4, an activity-dependent transcription factor important for GABAergic maturation, mice show cognitive deficits in the attentional set shifting task. Anxiety-like behavior also decreases from adolescence to adulthood in healthy wild-type mice; this observation is prevented in mice exposed to adolescent stress. I also found that chronic adolescent stress disrupts the maturation of specific components of the GABAergic system, including parvalbumin cells and their surrounding perineuronal nets, in a sex- and age-dependent manner. Disrupted GABAergic maturation by adolescent stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and anxiety, which often emerge during adolescent ages.
